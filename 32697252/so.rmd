```{r setup}
library(reticulate)
reticulate::use_python(python = "/opt/anaconda3/envs/ten2/bin/python", required = TRUE)
```


```{r}
TMP<-"Blue"
TMP
```

You can insert the value of an object created with an R code chunk into text like this:
The sky is `r TMP`

```{r}
pycode <- 
'
COLOR = "red"
print(COLOR)
'
pyrtn <- py_to_r(py_run_string(code = pycode))
```

You cannot do the same thing with Python, or other types of code:
The car is  `r pyrtn$COLOR`
