```{r setup}
library(reticulate)
use_condaenv("anaconda3", required = TRUE)
```


```{r}
TMP<-"Blue"
TMP
```

You can insert the value of an object created with an R code chunk into text like this:
The sky is `r TMP`

```{r}
py_code <- 'COLOR = "red"\nprint(COLOR)'
py_run_string(code = py_code)
```

You cannot do the same thing with Python, or other types of code:
The car is  `r py_run_string(code = py_code)`
