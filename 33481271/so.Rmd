This is an example of a very long, seemingly not breakable code line displayed
in a .html document.

```{r}
output <- "very long query for example url to some website or other text that needs to be in one line that cannot have a break.  maybe run on sentences, a lot of out of context quotes, yoda is a green dude.............................................."
output
```


How did that look?
