title: R and Python in a spin file.
---

This is an example of one way to write one R script, containing both R and
python, and can be spun to .Rmd via knitr::spin.


```{r label = "setup"}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
library(reticulate)
use_condaenv()
```


Create the file flights.csv to


```{r label = "create_flights_csv"}
write.csv(flights, file = "flights.csv")
```


The file flights.py will read in the data from the flights.csv file.  It can
be evaluated in this script via source_python().  This sould add a data.frame
called `py_flights` to the workspace.

```{r }
source_python(file = "flights.py")
```


And now, plot the results.


```{r label = "plot"}
ggplot(py_flights) + aes(carrier, arr_delay) + geom_point() + geom_jitter()
```
