Here I include graphics in a word document using the `emf` printing device.

```{r dev = 'emf', fig.ext = 'emf'}
require(devEMF)
plot(1:10, 1:10)

```

The plot is small, so I try to make it bigger with the `fig.height` and fig.width` options:

```{r dev='emf', fig.ext='emf', fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
require(devEMF)
plot(1:10, 1:10)

```

The plot region stayed the same size, and now I have super-small labels and points!

Finally, I try to use the `out.width` and `out.height` options to rescale the figure to a different size, but this produces nothing at all:

```{r dev='emf', fig.ext='emf', fig.height=10, fig.width=10, out.width = '5in', out.height= '5in'}
require(devEMF)
plot(1:10, 1:10)

```
